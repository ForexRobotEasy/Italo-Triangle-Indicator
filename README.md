## Indicator Description

The Italo Triangle Indicator is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This indicator is designed to identify triangle patterns in the price chart. Triangle patterns are formed by converging trendlines, creating a triangular shape on the chart. These patterns are considered to be continuation patterns, indicating a temporary consolidation before the price continues in the direction of the previous trend.

The Italo Triangle Indicator uses mathematical algorithms to detect and draw triangle patterns on the price chart. It analyzes the price data and identifies the points where the trendlines converge to form a triangle. The indicator then provides visual signals on the chart to indicate the presence of triangle patterns.

The Italo Triangle Indicator can be used for both manual trading and automated trading systems. Traders can use the indicator signals to identify potential trade setups and make informed trading decisions. It can be applied to any financial instrument and any time frame.
